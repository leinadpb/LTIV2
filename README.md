# LABTI V2
#### Complete new version of LTI (INTEC LABS) software
#### Electron App

## Functionalities
* Accept lab rules. Each time a student logs in into the computer, a window will pop up with the lab rules for the student to accept them. If the student has accepted it, only a reminder of this rules will appear. For accepting the rule, the student can search for the subject he/she is doing in the current trimester and a list of theachers will appear for you to select your theacher among them. Only teachers offering the selected subject will be available for the student to select from.
* Fill surveys. Every trimester the LABTI gives to their users a brief survey. Once they dicide to activate this survey it will automatically appear to the student each time it logs in into the computer. Once he/she fill it, it will no longer appear until the next trimester.

## Notes
* The student has to accept the lab rules each trimester.
* If you're admin user this software won't show up to you.
* Same rules applies for a user of type TEACHER, just that the survey displayed to he/she is different than the student.
